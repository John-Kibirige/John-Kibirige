## Hi, I am John Kibirige. 
An aspiring full stack software developer. I am a Chemical Engineer by profession. But my love and passion for coding and software development has grown over the years.
I am a Rookie in the world of programming but I am mesmerized and excited by the things I imagine to do with it. 

I am currently undertaking the [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/) software developer course. 

I am looking to collaborate on any front end developer projects for now
